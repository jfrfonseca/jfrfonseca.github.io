**Python Singleton Object Store - PySOS** - *dump*, that name sounds nice.  

So, yeah, in my time as a software developer in an increasingly S.O.A. world, I realized that certain objects within your system, mostly database clients, should not be initialized everytime your SOA service got a call. It is not only quite heavy on the database's end, but also time-consuming.  
So I (half-)remembered undergrad software engineering design patterns, specifically a pattern that provides an instance of an class that is unique - as in, cannot create a different instance within the scope of the application - the *Singleton*  
For this project, I want up to 5000 python lines if code for its main functionality, implementing those main requisites:  
- Be implemented in Python >= 3.5.2
- The object cannot be created as a different instance within the application namespace
    - However, subsequent calls to initialize the object will return the very same instance of the singleton
- The object must be static, available from its first ever call within the application until the end of the application's scope
- The architecture of the object must allow for several *Plug-Ins* to be implemented, each will be dynamically instantiated as *properties* of the object, acessible to the object's caller.
    - I don't know if sub objects can be properties in python. Will it make them unusable? Hard to tell.
- Plug-in dependencies must be dynamically imported
